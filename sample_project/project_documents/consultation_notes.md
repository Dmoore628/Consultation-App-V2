# Consultation Notes

## Client Information
**Client:** Damian Moore
**Organization:** Moore Tech
**Project:** RL Futures Trading System
**Industry:** 

## Project Description
Objective: The objective of this system is to train an agent (P.P.O.) to consistently achieve a configurable daily profit target by using historical futures price data to create a high fidelity simulator and master individual trading days through a meta day mastery mechanism and transfer learning, and finally deploying for live trading through the Tradovate API with robust risk controls after training is complete. The solution will deliver a jupiter notebook (or similar) with a high fidelity simulator that features proper design, reward mechanisms, day mastery protocols, and a PPO agent that has a seamless transition from simulation to live trading.
