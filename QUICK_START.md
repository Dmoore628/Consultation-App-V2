# Quick Start Guide - Multi-Agent Consulting System

## What This System Does

This is an **AI-powered consulting firm** that uses multiple expert AI agents working collaboratively to:

1. **Discover** your project needs through efficient conversation
2. **Analyze** requirements from multiple expert perspectives
3. **Design** technical solutions with peer review
4. **Generate** professional deliverables:
   - Discovery Report
   - Scope of Work (SOW)
   - Technical Architecture
   - Implementation Roadmap
   - Agent Coordination Report

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```powershell
cd c:\Users\Damia\Projects\Agents
.\crewai_env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r consulting_firm\requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start Ollama (Required)

```powershell
# In a separate terminal
ollama serve

# In another terminal, ensure model is available
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

### 3. Run the Application

```powershell
streamlit run consulting_firm\ui_app.py
```

### 4. Use the Multi-Agent System

In the Streamlit UI:

1. **Configuration Tab**
   - Model Provider: `ollama`
   - Model Name: `llama3.1:8b`
   - ✅ Enable "Use Multi-Agent Coordination"

2. **Project Setup Tab**
   - Enter your project folder path
   - Click "Load Project"

3. **Conversation Tab**
   - Start discovery conversation
   - Answer 3-5 strategic questions
   - System extracts information efficiently
   - Agents work in parallel with peer review

4. **Generate Tab**
   - Select maturity level: "discovery" or "sow"
   - Click "Generate Deliverables"
   - Watch agents collaborate in real-time

5. **Results Tab**
   - Download generated documents
   - Review agent coordination report
   - See which agents collaborated

## Key Features

- Parallel execution where possible
- Iterative refinement with peer feedback

### ✅ Expert Information Extraction
- Minimal questions (3-5 vs 20+)
- Active listening across domains
- Intelligent follow-up for gaps only
- Real-time coverage tracking

### ✅ Professional Output Quality
- Multiple expert perspectives synthesized
- Cross-functional validation
- Industry standards compliance
- Executive-level communication

## Understanding the Agent Team

### Core Agents:

1. **Engagement Manager** - Orchestrates process, synthesizes perspectives
2. **Product Strategist** - Business strategy, market positioning
3. **Lead Requirements Analyst** - Requirements elicitation, use cases
4. **Solutions Architect** - Technical architecture, system design
5. **Security Specialist** - Security requirements, compliance
6. **ML Research Scientist** - AI/ML capabilities assessment
7. **UX Strategist** - User experience design
8. **Senior Project Manager** - Timeline, resource planning
9. **Quality Assurance** - Comprehensive validation

### How They Collaborate:

```
Discovery Phase:
1. Engagement Manager frames the conversation
2. Strategist & Analyst work in parallel
3. They peer review each other's outputs
4. Architect, ML Specialist, UX assess feasibility
5. Project Manager synthesizes timeline
6. QA validates completeness
7. Engagement Manager produces final discovery

SOW Generation:
1. Multiple agents draft different sections
2. Cross-functional peer review
3. Iterative refinement (up to 3 cycles)
4. QA ensures consistency
5. Engagement Manager synthesizes final SOW
```

## Typical Session Flow

### Discovery Session (10-15 minutes)

1. **Opening Question**
   ```
   Agent: "Let's start with the big picture. Can you describe what you're 
   trying to build, the core problem it solves, and who will benefit from it?"
   ```

2. **Active Listening**
   - System extracts: objectives, users, capabilities, constraints
   - Tracks coverage across 8 information domains
   - Shows you: "Coverage: 75% - Need to clarify budget and timeline"

3. **Targeted Follow-ups**
   ```
   Agent: "I have a good understanding of the vision. Two quick clarifications:
   1. What's your target timeline?
   2. Any budget constraints we should be aware of?"
   ```

4. **Confirmation**
   ```
   Agent: "Let me confirm my understanding:
   - Building: [System summary]
   - For: [Target users]
   - Success measured by: [Metrics]
   - Key constraints: [Constraints]
   Is this accurate?"
   ```

### Generation Phase (3-5 minutes)

1. **Agent Collaboration Begins**
   ```
   [Strategist] Drafting strategic analysis...
   [Analyst] Drafting requirements specification...
   [Strategist] Reviewing Analyst's requirements... ✓ Approved
   [Analyst] Reviewing Strategist's strategy... ⚠️ Concerns noted
   [Strategist] Revising based on feedback...
   [Architect] Drafting technical feasibility...
   ...
   ```

2. **Quality Gates**
   - Each agent must pass peer review
   - QA validates all outputs
   - Iterative refinement if needed

3. **Deliverables Generated**
   - `01_discovery_report.md` - Comprehensive discovery
   - `00_agent_coordination_report.md` - Agent interactions

## Output Quality Indicators

### ✅ High Quality Indicators:
- Multiple perspectives included
- Specific, measurable criteria
- Industry standards referenced
- Risks and assumptions documented
- Professional tone throughout
- Cross-references between sections
- No placeholders like "[TBD]" or "[Insert X]"

### ⚠️ Review Needed:
- Generic statements
- Missing metrics
- Vague timelines
- No risk analysis
- Incomplete sections

## Troubleshooting

### "Model not responding"
```powershell
# Check Ollama is running
ollama list
ollama ps

# Restart Ollama if needed
# Stop: Ctrl+C in Ollama terminal
# Start: ollama serve
```

### "Agent coordination failed"
- Check `use_multi_agent=True` is enabled
- Review logs in Streamlit terminal
- Try sequential mode as fallback

### "Discovery takes too long"
- Ensure information extraction is enabled
- Answer initial questions comprehensively
- System should only ask 3-5 questions total

### "Output quality low"
- Enable multi-agent mode (peer review improves quality)
- Provide detailed discovery information
- Check validation report for issues

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Agent Team
```python
from consulting_firm.expert_team import ExpertTeam

team = ExpertTeam(outputs_path="custom/path")

# Customize which agents participate
artifacts = team.run(
    project_path="path/to/project",
    maturity="discovery",
    use_multi_agent=True,
    # Future: agent_team=["strategist", "analyst", "architect"]
)
```

### Programmatic Access
```python
from consulting_firm.agent_coordinator import AgentCoordinator
from consulting_firm.model_client import ModelClient

client = ModelClient(provider="ollama", model_name="llama3.1:8b")
coordinator = AgentCoordinator(client)

# Create custom workflow
workflow = coordinator.create_discovery_workflow(context)
coordination_report = coordinator.execute_workflow(workflow)
```

### Information Extraction
```python
from consulting_firm.information_extractor import InformationExtractor

extractor = InformationExtractor(client)

# Analyze user response
info = extractor.analyze_user_response(user_input, conversation_history)

# Check coverage
if info['coverage_score'] >= 0.85:
    print("Sufficient information gathered!")
else:
    # Generate targeted follow-up
    next_q = extractor.generate_next_question(info, 'targeted')
```
