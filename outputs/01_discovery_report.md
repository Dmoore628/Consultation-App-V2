## Discovery Framework
Hello! I'm Jennifer Martinez, your Engagement Manager at Elite Consulting Group.

I've reviewed your project details and I'm excited to work with you. Let me start by understanding your vision better.

Based on what you've shared, I can see this is an important initiative for your organization. To ensure we provide the most valuable consulting services, I'd like to explore a few key areas:

1. **Business Objectives**: What specific outcomes are you hoping to achieve?
2. **Target Users**: Who will be the primary users of this solution?
3. **Key Capabilities**: What are the most important features or capabilities?
4. **Timeline & Resources**: What's your target timeline and available resources?

This discovery conversation typically takes about 10-15 minutes and helps our specialist team provide tailored recommendations.

What would you like to start with?
