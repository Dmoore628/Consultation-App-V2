## Quick Tips

### For Best Results
- Provide detailed project context
- Upload relevant documents during intake
- Answer discovery questions thoroughly
- Review validation report before finalizing
- Use the refinement loop if needed

### Troubleshooting
- **If prompts seem too long:** Model provider handles truncation automatically
- **If validation too strict:** Review warnings (⚠️) separately from errors (❌)
- **If context not carrying through:** Check that documents are uploaded before discovery
