## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Multi-Agent Workflow Test
```python
from consulting_firm.expert_team import ExpertTeam

team = ExpertTeam(outputs_path="outputs")
artifacts = team.run(
    project_path="test_project",
    maturity="discovery",
    use_multi_agent=True
)

# Review outputs/00_agent_coordination_report.md for agent interactions
```

### 2. Information Extraction Test
```python
from consulting_firm.information_extractor import InformationExtractor
from consulting_firm.model_client import ModelClient

client = ModelClient(provider="ollama", model_name="llama3.1:8b")
extractor = InformationExtractor(client)

user_response = "I want to build a trading bot for retail traders..."
info = extractor.analyze_user_response(user_response, [])

print(f"Coverage: {info['coverage_score']*100}%")
print(f"Gaps: {len(info['critical_gaps'])}")
```

### 3. Validation Engine Test
```python
from consulting_firm.validation_engine import ValidationEngine

validator = ValidationEngine()
artifacts = {
    "discovery": "[Discovery content]",
    "sow": "[SOW content]"
}

report = validator.validate_all(artifacts, level="comprehensive")
print(f"Issues: {len(report['issues'])}")
print(f"Passes: {len(report['passes'])}")
```

### 4. Compare Sequential vs Multi-Agent
```python
# Test both modes with same project
team = ExpertTeam(outputs_path="outputs")

# Sequential mode
artifacts_seq = team.run(project_path, "discovery", use_multi_agent=False)

# Multi-agent mode
artifacts_ma = team.run(project_path, "discovery", use_multi_agent=True)

# Compare output quality, length, completeness
```
